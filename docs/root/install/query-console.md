# Query Console

The Query Console is an interactive Cypher editor accessible from the sidebar at `/app/query-console`.
It is designed for ad-hoc exploration of the Neo4j graph without requiring a saved report.

## Layout

The console is split into three areas:

- **Side panel** (left, collapsible) — shows the database schema or query history; toggle between them with the icons in the panel header.
- **Result panel** (top right) — displays query results in Graph, Table, or Raw format.
- **Query editor** (bottom right) — a multi-line Cypher editor with a Run button.

Press **Ctrl+Enter** (or **Cmd+Enter** on macOS) to run the query without reaching for the mouse.

## Side Panel

The collapsible left panel has two tabs, switched via icons in the panel header:

- **Database schema** (tree icon) — queries Neo4j on load to discover the current schema.
- **Query history** (clock icon) — shows your past queries from most recent to oldest.

When collapsed, both icons are visible as stacked buttons. Clicking either icon opens the panel on that tab. Clicking the active icon again closes the panel.

### Database Schema

| Section | Source | Click action |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| **NODES** | `CALL db.labels()` | Runs a path query for that label: `MATCH path = (n:\`Label\`)-[r]-(m) RETURN path LIMIT 25` |
| **RELATIONSHIPS** | `CALL db.relationshipTypes()` | Runs a path query for that type: `MATCH path = (a)-[r:\`TYPE\`]->(b) RETURN path LIMIT 25` |
| **PROPERTY KEYS** | `CALL db.propertyKeys()` | Runs a node query for that property: `MATCH (n) WHERE n.\`key\` IS NOT NULL RETURN n LIMIT 25` |

Clicking any item inserts the generated query into the editor and runs it immediately.
Node labels are colour-coded using the same palette as the graph panel, so colours are consistent across the UI.

### Query History

The history tab shows the last 500 queries you have run from the Query Console (report panel queries are not recorded). Queries are shown newest first, 20 per page. Hovering over a row shows the full query in a tooltip.

Clicking a history item **loads the query into the editor without running it**, so you can review or edit it before executing.

History is private to your account — you cannot see queries run by other users.

## Result Tabs

Results are shown in up to three tabs depending on what the query returns:

| Tab | When shown | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| **Graph** | Only when the query returns graph-compatible data | Interactive node-link diagram. Clicking a node or relationship opens the detail panel. |
| **Table** | Always | Tabular view. Columns are auto-detected from the result shape — no specific return alias required. |
| **Raw** | Always | Full JSON response from the API. |

The console defaults to the Graph tab when the data supports it, otherwise the Table tab.

## Graph View

The graph view is the same panel used in reports. It supports:

- **`RETURN path`** queries — Neo4j path objects are automatically unpacked into nodes and relationships.
- **Explicit map format** — `RETURN {nodes: [...], links: [...]}` with any alias (or none).

When a node or relationship is clicked, a detail panel slides in from the right showing its properties.
Clicking the canvas background deselects the item and shows a graph summary (node counts by label, relationship counts by type).

## Table View

The table view accepts any query return shape:

- `RETURN n.name AS name, n.org AS org` — named columns used directly.
- `RETURN n` — Neo4j node objects are unwrapped; properties become columns.
- `RETURN {key: value, ...}` — map values are unwrapped; keys become columns.

Nested objects (such as node or relationship values inside a path) are rendered in a human-readable format:
- Nodes → `(Label) name`
- Relationships → `[TYPE]`
- Paths → `(StartLabel) name → (EndLabel) name`
