# Dashboard Configuration

## Navigation Sections

Seizu's navigation currently supports a dashboard, and an arbitrary number of reports.
The dashboard is the landing page, and is meant as a general overview of the data in your graph.
Reports are topic-specific views of your graph data.

Both dashboards and reports use a list of rows, which contain a list of panels; both are grid-based.
Rows are rendered in the order specified in the configuration, and panels within rows are also rendered in the order specified.

## Panels

Seizu supports various panel types that can be used to visualize graph data.
See [the Panel schema](schema.html#panel) for more detailed info about specific fields.

### count

To simply display a count of a particular query, use a ``count`` panel.

![a count panel example](/images/count-panel.png)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| cypher | A cypher query to use for this panel. This is a reference to a query in the queries configuration section. The query must return the count as ``total``. |
| details\_cypher | A cypher to use for displaying a table view of the data, in a details view. This is a reference to a query in the queries configuration section. The query must return the rows as ``details``. |
| params | A list of parameters to pass into the query. See [the PanelParam schema](schema.html#panelparam) for more info. |
| caption | The caption to show as the title of this panel. |
| type | The type of panel. ``count``, for this panel type. |
| metric | The statsd metric to push for this panel, if stats pushing is enabled. |
| size | The width of this panel. |

#### Example

```yaml
        - cypher: cves
          details_cypher: cves-details
          caption: Total CVEs
          metric: cves.total
          type: count
          size: 3
```

### progress

To display a progress wheel, and x/y display of a particular query, use a ``progress`` panel.
By default, this panel will color the progress data based on a threshold of <70% error, >70% <100% primary, 100% success.

![a progress panel example](/images/progress-panel.png)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| cypher | A cypher query to use for this panel. This is a reference to a query in the queries configuration section. The query must return the counts as ``numerator`` and ``denominator``. |
| details\_cypher | A cypher to use for displaying a table view of the data, in a details view. This is a reference to a query in the queries configuration section. The query must return the rows as ``details``. |
| params | A list of parameters to pass into the query. See [the PanelParam schema](schema.html#panelparam) for more info. |
| caption | The caption to show as the title of this panel. |
| type | The type of panel. ``progress``, for this panel type. |
| threshold | The lower threshold percentage to consider this result an error. Set to `0` to disable threshold. Default: ``70`` |
| metric | The statsd metric to push for this panel, if stats pushing is enabled. |
| size | The width of this panel. |

          caption: Critical CVEs

## Inputs

Reports can define inputs that can be used to pass parameters into queries used in panels in the report.
These will be rendered at the top of the report, in the order specified in the configuration.

### autocomplete

An ``autocomplete`` input can be used to use results queried from the graph as inputs to panels.
End-users can select through a dropdown list of the values, or can type to search/autocomplete a value.

![an autocomplete input example](/images/autocomplete-input.png)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| input\_id | An ID for this input, that can be referenced from the params section of a panel. |
| cypher | A cypher query used to return the relevant data. This is __not__ a reference to a query, but the actual query to run. It's recommended to use ``DISTINCT`` for the values returned. The query must return the data as ``value``. |
| default | A dictionary with the default ``label`` and ``value`` for the input, when not set. |
| type | The type of input. ``autocomplete``, for this input type. |
| size | The width of this input. |

#### Example

```yaml
      - input_id: cve-severity-autocomplete-input
        cypher: >-
          MATCH (c:CVE)
          RETURN DISTINCT c.base_severity AS value
        label: CVE Severity
        type: autocomplete
        size: 2
```

### text

A ``text`` input can be used for user-defined input for panel query parameters.

![an text input example](/images/text-input.png)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| input\_id | An ID for this input, that can be referenced from the params section of a panel. |
| default | A dictionary with the default ``value`` for the input, when not set. |
| type | The type of input. ``text``, for this input type. |
| size | The width of this input. |

#### Example

```yaml
      - input_id: cve-id-regex
        label: Regex
        type: text
        size: 2
```

## Example Configuration

All panel types have an info button, which will show extra details about the panel, such as the query used, the parameters to the query, metrics that may be pushed with it, etc.
Non-table panel types can also show a query related to the panel as more details, in the details view.
