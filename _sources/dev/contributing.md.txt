## Contributing code

### File issues in Github

In general all enhancements or bugs should be tracked via github issues before PRs are submitted.
We don’t require them, but it’ll help us plan and track.

When submitting bugs through issues, please try to be as descriptive as possible.
 It’ll make it easier and quicker for everyone if the developers can easily reproduce your bug.

### Submit pull requests

Our only method of accepting code changes is through github pull requests.

### Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

We require a CLA for code contributions, so before we can accept a pull request we need to have a signed CLA.
When you open your first pull request, the CLA will show up as a test.
Please follow the test's link to sign the CLA, if you haven't done so yet.
