## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-23

The headline of this release is a security-hardening rewrite of the browser
authentication flow: OIDC moves from an in-browser library to a
**backend-for-frontend (BFF)** design where the IDP refresh token never reaches
JavaScript. This is a **breaking change for any deployment with auth enabled** —
see [Upgrade notes](#upgrade-notes-300) before deploying.

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- **Browser auth is now a backend-for-frontend flow** (#147). The OIDC
  Authorization Code + PKCE exchange happens on the server, not in the browser.
  The IDP refresh token lives only in an AES-256-GCM-encrypted, HttpOnly,
  SameSite=Strict cookie; the access token stays in React state and is never
  persisted. The `oidc-client-ts` browser library has been removed entirely.
- **IDP redirect URI changed.** The SPA-served `/auth/callback` route is gone;
  the backend now handles the redirect at **`/api/v1/auth/callback`**. Update
  the allowed redirect URIs in your identity provider.
- **`SESSION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is now required when auth is enabled.**
  Without it the backend cannot encrypt the session cookie and will fail to
  start the auth flow.
- **`OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` is no longer hardcoded** in `docker-compose.yml`. The
  backend derives the callback from each request's host, fixing the
  `:3000`-vs-`:8080` dev split.

### Added

- **Encrypted session cookie** carrying `{refresh_token, issued_at,
  absolute_expiry}`. Rolling refreshes can never extend the cookie past the
  IDP's absolute expiry — enforced both by browser `Max-Age` and on decrypt as
  defense-in-depth (#147).
- **Four BFF auth routes:** `GET /api/v1/auth/login`,
  `GET /api/v1/auth/callback`, `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`,
  `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` (#147).
- **CSRF protection** via a pure-ASGI middleware that requires `X-Seizu-Csrf` on
  mutating requests whenever the session cookie is present. Bearer-only clients
  (CLI, MCP, programmatic) are exempt and cannot downgrade the check (#147).
- **ID-token validation** on the code exchange — signature (via discovery
  JWKS), audience, issuer, and login nonce — gated by `OIDC_VALIDATE_ID_TOKEN`
  (#147).
- **RFC 7662 token introspection fallback** (`OIDC_ENABLE_TOKEN_INTROSPECTION`)
  for opaque (non-JWT) access tokens, shared by the REST resource server and the
  MCP auth middleware (#147).
- **Refresh-token revocation on logout** (`OIDC_REVOKE_REFRESH_TOKEN_ON_LOGOUT`),
  best-effort against the IDP's revocation endpoint (#147).
- **Cross-provider compatibility:** `OIDC_AUTHORIZE_EXTRA_PARAMS` (e.g. Google's
  `access_type=offline,prompt=consent`) so non-`offline_access` providers still
  issue refresh tokens (#147).
- **Shared list-view component library** adopted across all 13 consumers (6 list
  pages, 7 version-history pages, 2 detail dialogs): `RowMenu`,
  `ListPageHeader`, `ListViewState`, `ConfirmDeleteDialog`, and `DetailDialog`
  (+ `DetailSection`/`DetailCodeBlock`), all with tests. Net −1.8k lines of
  copy-pasted markup (#149).

### Changed

- Replaced the hand-rolled OIDC client with **authlib** (`AsyncOAuth2Client`,
  `token_endpoint_auth_method="none"` + PKCE) for RFC 6749/7636/OIDC mechanics
  and IDP-specific quirks (#147).
- `/auth/refresh` is serialized across browser tabs via the Web Locks API, with
  a module-level in-flight dedupe (also fixes a React StrictMode double-refresh
  race against rotating refresh tokens) (#147).
- AES-GCM associated data domain-separates the session and OAuth-state cookies
  that share the encryption key; cookies are scoped to `/api/v1/auth` (#147).
- Split-hostname support: authorize URLs are rewritten to the external origin
  when discovery uses an internal host (Docker dev), with
  `AUTHENTIK_HOST_BROWSER` as the cleaner path for Authentik (#147).
- `AGENTS.MD` compressed ~500→~259 lines, replacing duplicated tables (env vars,
  endpoints, brand colors, fuzzing) with pointers to their canonical sources
  (#149).

### Fixed

- Preserve the `Host` header through the Vite dev proxy (`changeOrigin: false`)
  so the backend derives the correct callback URL in dev (#147).
- OAuth callback errors are no longer reflected; required identity claims are
  guarded and optional profile claims used for display (#147).
- Removed the `NOTICE` reference to Lyft, which never held copyright (#144).

### Configuration

New environment variables (documented in `.env.example` /
`reporting/settings.py`):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SESSION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | — (**required w/ auth**) | AES-256-GCM key for the session cookie |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` | `seizu_session` | Session cookie name |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` | `64800` | Session cookie lifetime |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | — | For confidential-client IDPs |
| `OIDC_TOKEN_ENDPOINT_AUTH_METHOD` | `none` | Token endpoint auth method |
| `OIDC_REVOCATION_ENDPOINT_AUTH_METHOD` | `none` | Revocation endpoint auth method |
| `OIDC_REVOKE_REFRESH_TOKEN_ON_LOGOUT` | `true` | Revoke refresh token on logout |
| `OIDC_REFRESH_TOKEN_FALLBACK_TTL_SECONDS` | `2592000` | Fallback when IDP omits `refresh_expires_in` |
| `OIDC_AUTHORIZE_EXTRA_PARAMS` | — | Extra authorize params (e.g. Google offline) |
| `OIDC_ENABLE_TOKEN_INTROSPECTION` | `false` | RFC 7662 fallback for opaque tokens |
| `OIDC_INTROSPECTION_ENDPOINT_AUTH_METHOD` | inherits | Introspection endpoint auth method |
| `OIDC_DISCOVERY_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `3600` | Bounds discovery/JWKS staleness |
| `OIDC_VALIDATE_ID_TOKEN` | `true` | Validate ID token on code exchange |

### Upgrade notes {#upgrade-notes-300}

1. **Generate and set `SESSION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** (required when auth is
   enabled):
   ```bash
   python -c 'import base64,os; print(base64.b64encode(os.urandom(32)).decode())'
   ```
2. **Update your IDP's allowed redirect URIs** to
   `https://<your-host>/api/v1/auth/callback` (the SPA `/auth/callback` is
   removed).
3. **Remove any hardcoded `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI`** — the backend now derives it from
   the request host.
4. For **non-`offline_access` providers** (e.g. Google), set
   `OIDC_AUTHORIZE_EXTRA_PARAMS=access_type=offline,prompt=consent`.
5. For IDPs issuing **opaque access tokens**, set
   `OIDC_ENABLE_TOKEN_INTROSPECTION=true`.
6. Existing users holding the old `path=/` session cookie will briefly see two
   cookies in devtools until they log out and back in; the stale cookie is
   harmless.

  multi-threshold colors, row reordering, move-panel-between-rows, collapsible
  rows, optional headers, and type-representative skeletons (#66, #67, #70, #71).
